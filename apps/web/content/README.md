# howdy, i'm mike. welcome to my portfolio.

## what is this?

this is my portfolio site / current passion project. i had long been wanting to build some sort of portfolio site, and always thought it would be fun to build a desktop like site, so here we are.

## wait a sec

yes, you're absolutely right! a few other people have beat me to create sites like this - i'm sure you will recognize this if you are a posthog, cursor, or levelsio fan.

i hoped mine would be different, uniquely me, and most importantly fun to build. so i built it.

## why?

i originally wanted somehwere i could write / share some of the fun projects i've worked on. what we have so far is this. its definitely a work in progress but i've had a blast building it and learned a ton along the way.

hope you enjoy, any comments questions, or feature requests drop me an email to me@mikemoschitto.com

Built with ❤️ in 2025, inspired by 2000.
