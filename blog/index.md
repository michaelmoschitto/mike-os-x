# Welcome to My Blog

I'm **Mike**, a software developer based in Incline Village, NV, passionate about AI/ML, databases, products, and scaleable systems. Outside of programming I'm doing a lot of cycling, running, skiing and am avid baseball fan... go Dodgers.

## tf is this?

If you're asking yourself that you've probably found yourself here: https://os.mikemoschitto.com/?w=browser:https://blog.mikemoschitto.com. Thats my current passion project and portfolio site where I'm building out an "os x desktop" complete with a browser, some info about me, and of course a working terminal bc how could I not want to use vim in a linux terminal in the desktop in the browser.

## What I'm Working On

Currently I'm building AI platform and products, this site, and learning as much as I can.
I'm excited to do a bit more writing about how this is built and some of the tech behind it once I've shipped all the "mvp" features.
