# Welcome to My Blog

I'm **Mike**, a software developer based in Incline Village, NV, passionate about AI/ML, databases, products, and scaleable systems. Outside of programming I'm doing a lot of cycling, running, skiing and am avid baseball fan... go Dodgers.

## what is this?

If you're asking that, you've probably found yourself here: <a href="https://os.mikemoschitto.com/?w=browser:https://blog.mikemoschitto.com" style="color: #3b9cff; text-decoration: underline;">https://os.mikemoschitto.com/?w=browser:https://blog.mikemoschitto.com</a>. It's my current project, portfolio site, and blog.

I'm building "Mike OS X", complete with a browser, some info about me, and of course a working terminal. Because how could I not **want to vim in a linux terminal in a mac desktop in the browser??**

## What I'm Working On

Currently I'm building AI platform and products, this site, and learning as much as I can.
I'm excited to do a bit more writing about how this is built and some of the tech behind it once I've shipped the mvp.
